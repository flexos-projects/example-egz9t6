### Critical Missing Assets (Gaps)
The following assets are non-existent in the source data and must be created for the website to be viable. This is the project's primary content creation challenge.

*   **[GAP-01] Visual Portfolio:** **No case studies, project examples, or screenshots.** This is the most critical gap. Expertise is claimed but not shown.
*   **[GAP-02] Social Proof:** **No client testimonials or logos.** Trust is asserted but not validated by third parties.
*   **[GAP-03] Human Connection:** **No team photos or professional headshots.** The key personnel are a core asset, but they are currently invisible.
*   **[GAP-04] Thought Leadership:** **No blog, articles, whitepapers, or insights.** They are positioned as experts but do not share their expertise publicly.
*   **[GAP-05] Social Media Presence:** **Assumed to be inactive or non-existent.** A dormant professional presence (especially on LinkedIn) undermines B2B credibility.
