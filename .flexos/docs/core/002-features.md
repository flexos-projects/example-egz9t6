This feature inventory is ruthlessly prioritized to deliver maximum business value at launch and create a foundation for future growth.

### Priority 1: Launch Essentials (P1)

*These features are non-negotiable for launch. They directly address the core business needs and critical content gaps.*

1.  **Bilingual Architecture (DE/EN):**
    *   **Description:** A robust system for managing and displaying all content in both German and English, with a prominent, user-friendly language toggle in the header.
    *   **Rationale:** Core business requirement. Essential for serving their entire client base and projecting a professional image.

2.  **Case Study Engine:**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated "Our Work" section with a filterable grid of projects, leading to detailed case study pages. Each case study will follow a "Challenge, Solution, Impact" format with rich imagery, client details, and key metrics.
    *   **Rationale:** The #1 priority. This feature directly solves the "No Visual Proof" gap and is the most powerful tool for building trust and demonstrating expertise.

3.  **Benefit-Oriented Service Pages:**
    *   **Description:** Individual pages for each core service (Custom Web Apps, Digital Strategy, etc.) that focus on the business benefits for the client, not just the technical specifications. Will include sections on "Our Process" and link to relevant case studies.
    *   **Rationale:** Translates technical services into business value, addressing the "overly technical" feedback and speaking directly to decision-makers.

4.  **The "Human" About Us Page:**
    *   **Description:** A compelling page that tells the founder's story and features professional photos, detailed bios, and credentials for Dr. Anna Müller, Markus Schmidt, and Lena Meyer.
    *   **Rationale:** Leverages their key differentiator—the expertise of their people—to build a personal connection and trust that faceless competitors cannot.

5.  **"Insights" Hub (Blog):**
    *   **Description:** A simple but elegant blog section to house thought leadership articles. Will include author attribution (linking to team bios) and simple categorization.
    *   **Rationale:** Establishes authority, addresses the "No Thought Leadership" gap, and provides crucial fuel for the SEO strategy.

6.  **High-Trust Contact & Consultation Form:**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated contact page with a multi-step "Schedule a Consultation" form that asks qualifying questions (e.g., "What is your primary business challenge?"). Includes direct contact info (address, email, phone).
    *   **Rationale:** The primary conversion point of the site. The goal is to start a high-quality conversation, not just collect emails.

### Priority 2: Fast Follows (Post-Launch, Month 1)

*These features build on the P1 foundation to enhance social proof and lead nurturing.*

1.  **Client Logo Bar:**
    *   **Description:** A simple, elegant component for the homepage and About page displaying logos of happy clients.
    *   **Rationale:** A quick, powerful visual indicator of trust and experience.

2.  **Testimonial System:**
    *   **Description:** A system to embed compelling client quotes (with name, title, company) contextually on relevant service pages, case studies, and the homepage.
    *   **Rationale:** Directly addresses the "No Testimonials" gap and provides critical third-party validation at key decision points in the user journey.

3.  **Newsletter Integration:**
    *   **Description:** A simple sign-up form, likely in the footer and at the end of "Insights" articles, to capture emails for a future newsletter.
    *   **Rationale:** A low-effort way to build a marketing list and nurture potential leads with their expert content.

### Priority 3: Future Enhancements

*Long-term ideas to expand the site's utility and lead generation capabilities.*

1.  **Interactive Tools/Calculators:**
    *   **Description:** Simple, valuable tools like a "Cloud Readiness Assessment" quiz or an "ROI Calculator for Custom Software" that provide value in exchange for an email.
    *   **Rationale:** Powerful lead magnets that further position them as helpful experts.

2.  **Webinars & Events Section:**
    *   **Description:** A section to promote and archive webinars or local events hosted by the team.
    *   **Rationale:** A natural extension of the "Insights" strategy to engage with their audience in a more direct format.
