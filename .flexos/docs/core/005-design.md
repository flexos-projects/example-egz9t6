## The Vibe: Quiet Confidence

Our design direction is rooted in the brand personality of a **Seasoned Advisor**. The aesthetic must be professional, sophisticated, and trustworthy. We are building the digital equivalent of a well-appointed Munich office: calm, organized, and immediately reassuring. This is a design that communicates stability and intelligence, not fleeting trends.

### Color Palette: Trust and Clarity

The palette is intentionally minimalist and professional, designed to build trust and allow the content to shine.

*   **Primary:** Deep Navy Blue (`#192A51`)
    *   **Rationale:** This color conveys stability, intelligence, and deep expertise. It will be used for primary headlines, backgrounds, and key structural elements. It's the color of a trusted B2B partner.
*   **Accent:** Warm Ochre (`#D4A056`)
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a touch of warmth, energy, and optimism. This accent is sophisticated and human. It will be used sparingly but with high impact for calls-to-action, links, and key data highlights, drawing the user's eye to what matters most.
*   **Neutrals:** White (`#FFFFFF`) and Light Gray (`#F4F5F7`)
    *   **Rationale:** Generous use of white space is critical. It creates a clean, uncluttered, and breathable layout that enhances readability and focus. The light gray will be used for subtle background differentiation in sections.

### Typography Direction: Modern Readability

The typography pairing is chosen to balance modern technical precision with classic authority.

*   **Headlines:** **Inter** (Sans-Serif)
    *   **Rationale:** A highly legible, geometric sans-serif that feels modern, clean, and confident. Its clarity is perfect for communicating key messages with authority and precision.
*   **Body Copy:** **Lora** (Serif)
    *   **Rationale:** An elegant, contemporary serif that is exceptionally comfortable for reading longer passages. It adds a touch of gravitas and academic rigor, reinforcing the expertise of the founders and the depth of the content in case studies and articles.

### Photography & Visual Style

The visual tone is structured, purposeful, and authentic. **No generic stock photos.**

*   **People:** High-quality, professional portraits of the team. Photos should be well-lit, with a consistent background, conveying both professionalism and approachability. Team photos should look collaborative and genuine.
*   **Case Studies:** A mix of clean UI mockups (presented in device frames), data visualizations, diagrams illustrating process flows, and potentially, authentic photos of the client's environment (if available).
*   **Abstract & Architectural:** To supplement brand imagery, we will use high-quality, abstract photos focusing on architectural details (especially modern Munich architecture), textures, and light. This creates a sophisticated, non-literal visual language that feels premium.
*   **Icons:** A clean, consistent, line-art icon set will be used to visually represent services and key concepts.

### Key Visual Moments & Layout

*   **Aesthetic:** "Information design" over decoration. Uncluttered, bold, and confident.
*   **Layout:** A strong, grid-based layout with generous white space is paramount. This creates order and focus.
*   **Hero Treatment:** Full-width hero sections with a strong typographic headline, clear subtext, and a prominent call-to-action. No distracting background videos.
*   **Service Cards:** Clean, minimalist cards on the homepage and services hub, using an icon and a strong headline to communicate the offering clearly.
*   **Testimonial Style:** Presented with emphasis. A large, impactful pull quote in the Lora typeface, with clear attribution and the client's logo.

### Mobile-First Priorities

The design will be fully responsive, but the mobile experience is a top priority.
*   Navigation will collapse into a clean, easy-to-use mobile menu.
*   Typography will be scaled for optimal readability on small screens.
*   CTAs will be prominent and easily tappable.
*   The "quiet confidence" vibe must be maintained, avoiding a cramped or cluttered feeling on mobile.
