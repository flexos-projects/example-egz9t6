---

### **1. Business Facts**

*   **Company Name:** Appears to be "Example Web Solutions" or similar.
*   **Services:** Web Design, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and Digital Marketing. They specifically mention "SEO-Beratung" (SEO Consultation).
*   **Location:** Schillerstraße 25, 80336 München, Germany. This is a physical address, suggesting a local Munich-based agency.
*   **Team Size:** 10 employees (as per LinkedIn).
*   **History:** Founded in 2012 (as per LinkedIn).
*   **Key Offer:** They promote a "free consultation."

### **2. Content Worth Keeping**

*   **Google Reviews:** The Google Business Profile shows a **4.9-star rating from 42 reviews**. This is a major trust signal and a critical asset. The full text of these reviews should be curated and prominently featured on the new website (e.g., on the homepage, a testimonials page).
*   **Testimonial (Yelp):** A positive review from "Markus T." praising them for being "patient and professional" and delivering a "fantastic result." This is a specific, usable quote.
*   **Portfolio/Case Studies:** A portfolio is mentioned on Yelp, but the link is broken. The underlying project assets and case study data are highly valuable and must be recovered from the client to be showcased on the new site.

### **3. SEO Intelligence**

*   **Existing Rankings:** The site holds existing authority for key local terms.
    *   `webdesign münchen`: Ranking at position #4.
    *   `seo agentur münchen`: Ranking at position #8.
    *   This indicates a solid SEO foundation we must protect and build upon. The new site must be technically optimized to maintain or improve these rankings.
*   **Key Pages:** The homepage (`/`) and a German-language service page (`/services/seo-beratung`) are indexed and ranking. This suggests a basic site structure is in place.
*   **Google Business Profile (GBP):** The GBP is well-maintained with a strong rating, address, phone number, and hours. This is a core local SEO asset. The new website must have its Name, Address, and Phone (NAP) information perfectly consistent with the GBP.

### **4. Competitive Landscape**

*   **Direct Competitors (from search results):**
    *   `web-wizards.de`
    *   `digital-growth.de`
    *   `top-seo-munich.de`
*   **Competitor Positioning:**
    *   `web-wizards.de`: "Modern Webdesign & Performance Marketing" (focus on modern results).
    *   `digital-growth.de`: "Your Partner for Digital Growth" (focus on strategic partnership).
    *   `top-seo-munich.de`: "The #1 SEO Experts in Munich" (focus on authority and specialization).
*   **Takeaway:** Competitors use strong, benefit-driven language. `example.com`'s current meta description "affordable web design" may position them as a budget option, which could conflict with a more premium/expert brand identity.

### **5. Voice & Language**

*   **Tone:** Professional but accessible ("We build beautiful, functional websites"). Not overly corporate or jargony.
*   **Language:** **Critically bilingual (German/English).** They are ranking for German keywords ("Webdesign München") and have German-language URLs (`/seo-beratung`), but also use English terms ("Digital Marketing").
*   **Action Item:** The redesign must have a robust bilingual strategy (e.g., a clear language switcher, proper `hreflang` tags for SEO) to serve both German and potentially English-speaking clients. The default language should likely be German given the location and keywords.

### **6. Missing Pieces**

*   **A Functional Portfolio/Case Studies Section:** The broken Yelp link indicates this is a top priority. A modern agency site is ineffective without proof of work.
*   **Team Page:** With 10 employees, a team page is a significant missed opportunity to build trust and humanize the brand.
*   **Blog/Insights/Resources:** Competitors position themselves as "experts" and "partners." A blog is essential for demonstrating expertise, improving SEO with fresh content, and attracting clients seeking information.
*   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** The "free consultation" is mentioned but needs to be a prominent, actionable element throughout the new site (e.g., buttons, forms).
*   **Online Booking/Scheduling:** To modernize the "free consultation" offer, integrating a scheduling tool (like Calendly) would reduce friction for potential clients.

### **7. Red Flags**

*   **Outdated Social Media:** The last Facebook post was in **October 2021**. This makes the business appear inactive or neglected. The client must either commit to a content strategy or the social links should be removed from the new site to avoid a negative impression.
*   **Broken Links:** The portfolio link on their Yelp profile is broken. This signals a lack of attention to detail and damages credibility. A full crawl of the existing site for other broken links is necessary.
*   **Potentially Conflicting Positioning:** The term "affordable" in the SEO meta description may undercut the value of a professional 10-person agency founded in 2012. We need to clarify with the client if they want to be the "cheap option" or the "expert value option."
