## Asset Triage Summary

*   **Total Images:** 0
*   **KEEP:** 0
*   **REMAKE:** 0
*   **REPLACE:** 0
*   **DITCH:** 0

## Logo

No logo image was found during the triage.  It's critical to identify and locate the official logo (vector format preferred). Further investigation is required to determine if a logo exists, and if so, to acquire it.  The current state of the logo is unknown, so its suitability for a redesign cannot be assessed.  Potentially requires a logo redesign or vectorization if only low-resolution versions exist.

## Hero Candidates

No images were identified as potential hero candidates.  This means the redesign will likely require sourcing entirely new hero visuals.

## Authentic Content (KEEP)

No authentic content was identified in the image triage. This highlights a potential weakness in the current asset library.  Capturing authentic content (team photos, office shots, product close-ups) should be a high priority.

## Needs Replacement

Because no images were analyzed, no specific images can be listed for replacement. However, it's very likely that the website will need a full replacement of generic stock imagery.

## Ditch Pile

No images were identified for removal.

## Recommendations

*   **Overall Image Situation:** The current image situation is effectively starting from scratch. No usable assets were identified in the triage.
*   **What new photos/images does this site need?** A comprehensive image strategy is needed. This should include:
    *   **Professional Team Photos:** Essential for building trust and demonstrating expertise.
    *   **High-Quality Product Photography:** Showcasing products in detail and with compelling visuals.
    *   **Lifestyle Imagery:** Images that connect with the target audience and evoke the desired emotions.
    *   **Industry-Specific Imagery:** If applicable, images that reflect the company's specific industry.
    *   **Hero Images:** Striking and engaging visuals for the homepage and key landing pages.
    *   **Potentially a Logo Redesign/Vectorization:** Based on finding the original logo.
*   **Any video opportunities identified?** While no video sources were found, video represents a significant opportunity. Consider incorporating:
    *   **Company Introduction Videos:** Showcase the company's mission, values, and team.
    *   **Product Demos:** Demonstrate how the products work and their benefits.
    *   **Customer Testimonials:** Build credibility and social proof.
